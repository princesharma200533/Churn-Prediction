    FINAL PROJECT REPORT
    =====================================
    
    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
    This project successfully implemented an Artificial Neural Network to predict
    customer churn for ConnectSphere Telecom. The model processes customer usage
    patterns and account details to identify at-risk customers, enabling proactive
    retention strategies.
    
    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ‚Ä¢ Developed end-to-end machine learning pipeline
    ‚Ä¢ Built robust ANN with proper architecture
    ‚Ä¢ Achieved comprehensive model evaluation
    ‚Ä¢ Generated actionable business insights
    ‚Ä¢ Created exportable customer risk assessments
    
    TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
    ‚Ä¢ Dataset: 2,000 synthetic customer records
    ‚Ä¢ Features: 7 input variables (usage, charges, contract details)
    ‚Ä¢ Model: 2-layer ANN with ReLU/Sigmoid activations
    ‚Ä¢ Training: 50 epochs with validation monitoring
    ‚Ä¢ Evaluation: Multi-metric assessment with visualizations
    
    BUSINESS IMPACT:
    The model enables ConnectSphere to:
    ‚Ä¢ Identify high-risk customers before they churn
    ‚Ä¢ Prioritize retention efforts based on probability scores
    ‚Ä¢ Optimize marketing spend on most likely churners
    ‚Ä¢ Develop targeted retention strategies by customer segment
    
    RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1. Deploy model in production for real-time scoring
    2. Integrate with CRM systems for automated alerts
    3. Develop retention campaigns based on risk profiles
    4. Monitor model performance and retrain regularly
    5. Expand feature set with additional customer data
